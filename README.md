ML:
- My friend Fayza Khaled Mashaal helped me in the UI of the project.
- In this project you give the x and y location and the size of the picture so the code classify the eye is left or right eye.

______
GA:
This project you give it the center of the two eyes in the given picture and it gives you the picture with the boundries of the pupil

____
CG:
Install the next packages to make it work [in python]: turtle

Every one of those codes has its own work so:
1. Maze code: is a maze game that you could play and it's also easy than you think because the boundries is just colors not a boundries.
2. Playing with Spongebob code: there's a pixel that the game don't want you to press on so its a pixel and have a red color around it if you press on it spongebob will die.
3. Mickey and Minnie mouse code: is a small episod talking about Covid-19.
